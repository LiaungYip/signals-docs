A Path Signal is an enhanced [Block Signal](/block_signal). If you do not know what a Block Signal is it is strongly recommended to read this first.

Path Signals can replace any place where a Block Signal is used, however, Path Signals usually show their usefulness in intersections.

Imagine this situation below.

A main cart line traveling horizontally branches off vertically. In this example the entire intersection forms one big block section, indicated with White Wool. If normal Block Signals were used, only one cart could be on the intersection at all time. Even when the paths of the carts do not cross, which is the case when two carts travel in opposite direction on the main line horizontally.

Path Signals resolve this issue. Path Signals allow carts to pass when the cart being routed does not intersect the path of the other carts on the next block. For this to work do note however that all carts need to have a path. This means that they need to have reachable [destinations](/station_marker).
